TODO django.contrib.gis
=======================

- Change the name GeoDjango? The current name seems to imply that the project
  is separated from Django itself. Rename it to something more specific like
  django.contrib.gis?
- Get rid of geodjango.org or make something really useful out of it
- Get rid of "GeoDjango" references in pages titles
- Document form field classes
